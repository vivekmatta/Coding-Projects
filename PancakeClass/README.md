You have one pan that can fit capacity pancakes at a time. Using this pan you must cook numCakes pancakes. Each pancake must be cooked for five minutes on each side, and once a pancake starts cooking on a side it has to cook for five minutes on that side. However, you can take a pancake out of the pan when you're ready to flip it after five minutes and put it back in the pan later to cook it on the other side.
Write the method, minutesNeeded, that returns the shortest time needed to cook numCakes pancakes in a pan that holds capacity pancakes at once.
