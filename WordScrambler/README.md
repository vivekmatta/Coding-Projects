In the project, I created a word scrambler that scrambles the middle letters of a word, keeping the 
first and last letter the same. If the word is less than three letters, then it will just return the word. Only words with more
than three letters will work. There is a gatsby text and sample text as a test for the code. Just simply change the 
text in the code "src/file.txt" with a .txt file that you import to the class.
