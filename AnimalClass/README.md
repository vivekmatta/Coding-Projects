In this class, I created a main class "Animal.java" and within that, I made two sub-classes "Dog.java" and "Cat.java". 
I also made a class within the "Dog.java" class called "Poodle.java". 
This was for me to get a better understanding of the idea "Inheritance".
The "AnimalClassRunner.java" is the runner file (I used Intellij IDEA).
Thanks
